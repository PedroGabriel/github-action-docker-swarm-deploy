# About this project
This is a GitHub Action intended to simplify the development experience while deploying with Docker Swarm.

### Features:
- üòÉ Simple to use
- üèóÔ∏è Bring your own container + configuration
- üíØ Replicate 100% of production from Development to CI to Deployment

# Usage
Here is an example workflow:

```yml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: serversideup/github-action-docker-swarm-deploy@v2
        with:
          ssh_deploy_private_key: "${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}"
          ssh_remote_hostname: "${{ secrets.SSH_REMOTE_HOSTNAME }}"
          registry: "ghcr.io"
          registry-username: "${{ github.actor }}"
          registry-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          stack_name: "${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}"
          md5_file_path: "./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/prod/traefik.yml"
          md5_variable_name: "SPIN_MD5_HASH_TRAEFIK_YML"

### Getting the MD5 Checksum of a file
We include an optional input to get the MD5 checksum of a file. This is useful if you're working with Docker Configs and you only want the service to update if the file has changed. You just need to set the following inputs (a full example is available at the top of this document):

```yml
steps:
  - uses: serversideup/github-action-docker-swarm-deploy@v2
    with:
      md5_file_path: "./path/to/my/file.txt"
      md5_variable_name: "MY_FILE_MD5"
```

This will store the MD5 checksum of the file at `./path/to/my/file.txt` in the environment variable `MY_FILE_MD5`.
